# Python Coding Style Guide

This project adheres to the **PEP 8 -- Style Guide for Python Code**.

All Python code written by the AI must conform to these standards to ensure readability and consistency.

## Key Principles

- **Readability Counts**: Code is read more often than it is written.
- **Consistency**: Adhere to a consistent style across the entire project.

## Tools

- **Linter & Formatter**: `ruff` will be used to automatically enforce PEP 8 compliance, format code, and handle imports.

## Naming Conventions

- `lowercase` for variables, functions, and modules.
- `UPPERCASE` for constants.
- `PascalCase` for classes.
- `_leading_underscore` for non-public attributes.

This document is a high-level guide. For detailed rules, refer to the official [PEP 8 documentation](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).
