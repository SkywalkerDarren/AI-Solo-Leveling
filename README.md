# AI Solo Leveling

This project is an experiment to test the self-improvement capabilities of AI.

The goal is to see if an AI can, starting from a simple prompt, develop a complex project on its own.

This is inspired by the "Solo Leveling" concept, where a character starts weak and continuously grows stronger by completing challenges. In this case, the AI is the character, and the challenges are the development tasks.

The project will be developed by an AI, with minimal human intervention. The AI will be responsible for:

* Writing the code
* Testing the code
* Debugging the code
* Adding new features
* Improving the existing code

The project will be developed in the open, and all the code will be available on GitHub.

Let's see how far the AI can go!
