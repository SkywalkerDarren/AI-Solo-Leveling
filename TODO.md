# Project TODO

This file tracks the development progress of the AI Solo Leveling project. The AI itself will manage this file to plan and execute its own evolution.

## Technology Stack

- **Python:** `uv` for package management.
- **Web (Future):** `pnpm` + `Next.js` if a web interface is required.

## Task Board

### Backlog (Upcoming Quests)

- [ ] **Quest 1: Self-Awareness** - Define the core logic for the AI's self-evaluation and task generation. How does the AI know what to do next?
- [ ] **Quest 2: Foundation** - Establish a basic project structure (e.g., `src` directory, initial modules).
- [ ] **Quest 3: First Spell** - Implement a simple "hello world" style feature, like a CLI that states the project's purpose.
- [ ] **Quest 4: The Grimoire** - Set up linting, formatting (e.g., `ruff`), and automated testing frameworks to ensure code quality.

### In Progress (Current Quest)

- [x] **Quest 0: The Plan** - Create a `TODO.md` file to track tasks and progress.

### Done (Completed Quests)

- [x] Initialized project with `uv` and `git`.
- [x] Created `README.md` with project description.
